# AGRIFARM-AI

**AGRIFARM-AI** is an Intelligent Management System (IMS) designed for climate-resilient smart agriculture. By integrating hybrid Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Radio Frequency (RF) networks with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the platform enables autonomous precision farming in controlled environment agriculture (CEA).

## Key Features
- **Hybrid VLC/RF Communication:** Optimized for crop-safe data transmission and high-bandwidth offloading using LED grow lights.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Autonomous coordination of irrigation, fertilization, and energy management agents.
- **Climate Resilience:** Translates climate forecasts into actionable autonomous agricultural decisions.
- **Agentic AI:** Context-aware decision support for complex agricultural scenarios.

## Research Team
- **Coordinator:** Dr. Trung Kien Ngo (Hanoi School of Business and Management, VNU)
- **Partners:** Technical University of Munich, Chulalongkorn University, Ghent University/imec.

*Status: Under Active Development*
